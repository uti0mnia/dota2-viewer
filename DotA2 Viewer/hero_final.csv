"Earthshaker","Melee","Support - Initiator - Disabler - Nuker","Like a golem or gargoyle, Earthshaker was one with the earth but now walks freely upon it. Unlike those other entities, he created himself through an act of will, and serves no other master. In restless slumbers, encased in a deep seam of stone, he became aware of the life drifting freely above him. He grew curious. During a season of tremors, the peaks of Nishai shook themselves loose of avalanches, shifting the course of rivers and turning shallow valleys into bottomless chasms. When the land finally ceased quaking, Earthshaker stepped from the settling dust, tossing aside massive boulders as if throwing off a light blanket. He had shaped himself in the image of a mortal beast, and named himself Raigor Stonehoof. He bleeds now, and breathes, and therefore he can die. But his spirit is still that of the earth; he carries its power in the magical totem that never leaves him. And on the day he returns to dust, the earth will greet him as a prodigal son.","16 + 1.80","12 + 1.40","22 + 2.90","24 - 34","310","2.68","3","1","568","208","46-56","3","1800 / 800","150","N/A","15","1,339","536","87-97","5","1800 / 800","150","N/A","25","2,270","1,030","136-146","10","1800 / 800","150","N/A","4","Fissure","Slams the ground with a mighty totem, creating an impassable ridge of stone while stunning and damaging enemy units along its line.","The Nishian totem splits the world to its core with tectonic force.","125/140/155/170","15","ABILITY: Point Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,DAMAGE: 110 / 160 / 210 / 260,FISSURE RANGE: 1400,FISSURE DURATION: 8,STUN DURATION: 1 / 1.25 / 1.5 / 1.75","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/earthshaker_fissure_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/vTbNwc5Tqwc?hd=1&rel=0","Enchant Totem","Empowers Earthshaker's totem, causing it to deal extra damage on the next attack.Upgradable by Aghanim's Scepter.","Raigor's gorilla strength can destroy mountains.","20/30/40/50","5","ABILITY: No Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE: 0 / 0 / 0 / 0,BONUS: 100% / 200% / 300% / 400%,DURATION: 14 / 14 / 14 / 14,SCEPTER JUMP DISTANCE: 900","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/earthshaker_enchant_totem_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/OkSsLAN7mbk?hd=1&rel=0","Aftershock","Causes the earth to shake underfoot, adding additional damage and stuns to nearby enemy units when Earthshaker casts his abilities.","The earth trembles beneath the mighty footsteps of Raigor.","","","ABILITY: Passive,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,DAMAGE: 50 / 75 / 100 / 125,RADIUS: 300,DURATION: 0.6 / 0.9 / 1.2 / 1.5","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/earthshaker_aftershock_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/2xcM8xccDIs?hd=1&rel=0","Echo Slam","Shockwaves travel through the ground, damaging enemy units.

After years of small sorties, and increasingly bold and devastating attacks, the demon fleet flung all its carnivorous ships at the Trembling Isle. Desperate, the Suicide-Mages of Cladd committed their ultimate rite, summoning a host of ancestral spirits to protect the fleet. Against the demons, this was just barely enough to turn the tide. As Kunkka watched the demons take his ships down one by one, he had the satisfaction of wearing away their fleet with his ancestral magic. But at the battle's peak, something in the clash of demons, men and atavistic spirits must have stirred a fourth power that had been slumbering in the depths. The waves rose up in towering spouts around the few remaining ships, and Maelrawn the Tentacular appeared amid the fray. His tendrils wove among the ships, drawing demon and human craft together, churning the water and wind into a raging chaos. What happened in the crucible of that storm, none may truly say. The Cataract roars off into the void, deserted by its former denizens. Kunkka is now The Admiral of but one ship, a ghostly rig which endlessly replays the final seconds of its destruction.

His mother died in childbirth; his father, a farrier for the Last King of Slom, was trampled to death when he was five. Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king's menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks. \nOver the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation.  He could, in fact, speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy.  He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds.  The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped. Now a man, Karroch the Beastmaster has not lost his ability to converse with wild creatures.

Seeing no honor to be gained in dragon-murder, Knight Davion prepared to turn away and leave his old foe to die in peace. But a voice crept into his thoughts, and Slyrak gave a whispered plea that Davion might honor him with death in combat. Davion agreed, and found himself rewarded beyond expectation for his act of mercy: As he sank his blade in Slyrak's breast, the dragon pierced Davion's throat with a talon. As their blood mingled, Slyrak sent his power out along the Blood Route, sending all its strength and centuries of wisdom to the knight.

The son of the son of a clockmaker, Rattletrap was many years apprenticed to that trade before war rode down from the mountains and swept the plains villages free of such innocent vocations.  'Your new trade is battle,' his dying father told him as the village of their ancestors lay in charred and smoking ruins.    \nIt is a poor tradesman who blames his tools, and Rattletrap was never one to make excuses.  After burying his father among the ruins of their village, he set about to transform himself into the greatest tool of warfare that any world had ever seen.

"Omniknight","Melee","Support - Durable - Nuker","Purist Thunderwrath was a hard-fighting, road-worn, deeply committed knight, sworn to the order in which he had grown up as squire to elder knights of great reputation. He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt.","17 + 1.80","15 + 1.75","22 + 2.80","31 - 41","305","5.1","3","1","568","221","53-63","5","1800 / 800","150","900","15","1,313","549","92-102","9","1800 / 800","150","900","25","2,225","1,043","140-150","14","1800 / 800","150","900","4","Purification","Instantly heals a friendly unit and damages all nearby enemy units.","Priests of the Omniscience are adept at removing impurities from fellow warriors.","100/120/140/160","10","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Allied Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Pure,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,HEAL/DAMAGE: 90 / 180 / 270 / 360,RADIUS: 260","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_purification_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/ohj0Wq-YJAQ?hd=1&rel=0","Repel","Creates a divine barrier around a target unit which grants them Spell Immunity and 100% resistance to Magic Damage.","When faced with the pit of sacrifice, Purist's resilience to magic was tested and affirmed.","50/50/50/50","14","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Heroes,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,DURATION: 4 / 6 / 8 / 10","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_repel_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/rlLqiwxB4ko?hd=1&rel=0","Degen Aura","Greatly degenerates the movement and attack capabilities of enemy units that stray too near.","The holy embodiment of Purist Thunderwrath is enough to weaken those of lesser faith.","","","ABILITY: Passive, Aura,AFFECTS: Enemies,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,MOVEMENT SLOW: 10% / 18% / 26% / 34%,ATTACK SLOW: 10 / 18 / 26 / 34,RADIUS: 350","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_degen_aura_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/P3yU81TYOYU?hd=1&rel=0","Guardian Angel","Omniknight summons a Guardian Angel that grants immunity from physical damage.Upgradable by Aghanim's Scepter","The All Seeing One casts down his protection over those that Purist calls friend.","125/175/250","150","ABILITY: No Target,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: Yes,DURATION: 6 / 7 / 8,RADIUS: 600 / 600 / 600,SCEPTER DURATION: 8 / 9 / 10","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/omniknight_guardian_angel_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/SIBSA30sMz4?hd=1&rel=0"

Against the ancient rites of the Dezun Order, Huskar's spirit had been saved from eternity, but like all who encounter the Nothl he found himself irrevocably changed. No longer at the mercy of a mortal body, his very lifeblood became a source of incredible power; every drop spilled was returned tenfold with a fierce, burning energy. However this newfound gift infuriated Huskar, for in his rescue from the Nothl, Dazzle had denied him a place among the gods. He had been denied his own holy sacrifice. In time the elders of the order sought to expand their influence and Huskar, they agreed, would be a formidable tool in their campaign. Yet becoming a mere weapon for the order that denied him his birthright only upset him further.

However, when adulthood came calling he pushed aside the family trade to try his hand at manufacturing gold through Alchemy. In an act of audacity befitting his reputation, Razzil announced he would transmute an entire mountain into gold. Following two decades of research and spending and preparation, he failed spectacularly, quickly finding himself imprisoned for the widespread destruction his experiment wrought. Yet Razzil was never one to take a setback lightly, and sought escape to continue his research. When his new cellmate turned out to be a fierce ogre, he found just the opportunity he needed. After convincing the ogre not to eat him, Razzil set about carefully concocting a tincture for it to drink, made from the moulds and mosses growing in the prison stone work. In a week's time, it seemed ready. When the ogre drank the potion, it flew into an unstoppable berserker rage, destroying the cell bars and exploding through walls and guards alike. They soon found themselves lost somewhere in the forest surrounding the city with a trail of wreckage in their wake and no signs of pursuit.  In the tonic's afterglow, the ogre seemed serene, happy, and even eager.

Soon they arrived with tools to cut and with flames to burn, and often the Treants would ponder: who are these fragile, industrious creatures? What now had become of the wild, green world? There came and went an age of questions and of doubts, a thousand summers of long traditions set to scrutiny, while more and more the outsiders died and fed their earth. When all that bloomed had finally finished their say, curiosity had overcome caution.

"Centaur Warrunner","Melee","Durable - Initiator - Disabler - Nuker - Escape","It's said that a centaur's road is paved with the corpses of the fallen.  For the one called Warrunner, it has been a long road indeed.  To outsiders, the four-legged clans of Druud are often mistaken for simple, brutish creatures.  Their language has no written form; their culture lacks pictographic traditions, structured music, formalized religion.  For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self.  If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist.  He rose to dominance on the proving grounds of Omexe, an ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rites.  As his fame spread, spectators came from far and wide to see the great centaur in action.  Always the first to step into the arena, and the last to leave, he composes a masterpiece in each guttering spray, each thrust of blood-slickened blade-length.  It is the poetry of blood on steel, flung in complex patterns across the pale sands of the killing floor.\nWarrunner defeated warrior after warrior, until the arena boomed with the cheering of his name, and he found himself alone, the uncontested champion of his kind.  The great belt of Omexe was bestowed, wrapped around his broad torso, but in his victory, the death-artist found only emptiness.  For what is a warrior without a challenge?  The great centaur galloped out of Omexe that day with a new goal.  To his people, Warrunner is the greatest warrior to ever step into the arena.  Now he has set out to prove he is the greatest fighter who has ever lived.","15 + 1.60","15 + 2.00","23 + 4.00","32 - 34","300","3.1","3","1","587","195","55-57","3","1800 / 800","150","900","15","1,651","486","111-113","7","1800 / 800","150","900","25","2,791","954","171-173","13","1800 / 800","150","900","4","Hoof Stomp","Slams the ground, stunning and damaging nearby enemy units.","When the mighty hoof of the Warrunner touches soil, the tremors are felt far and wide.","130","13","ABILITY: No Target,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,RADIUS: 315,STUN DURATION 2 / 2.25 / 2.5 / 2.75,STOMP DAMAGE: 100 / 150 / 200 / 250","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/centaur_hoof_stomp_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/FuWaTlMJwjM?hd=1&rel=0","Double Edge","Centaur strikes a mighty blow at melee range, damaging both himself and a small area around the target.

Sleep eluded him; he only built.  Months had passed since he had shut himself in his uncle's workshop, and his deliverance was nearly complete.  He rubbed his back as his eyes drifted shut, and saw a blanket of flowers floating on the placid waves of Augury Bay before exploding into a cloud of pollen that silenced lives as it seized the lungs.  He woke with a choking start.  For hours the rhythmic sound of a whetstone filled the shop as he sharpened a set of massive blades, his mind filled with images of strangling vines garroting neighbors, enwrapping homes.  The flooding of Augury Bay had been nothing compared to the violent horrors the waters left to take root beyond the city walls.  But the saw-suit would make him strong and safe he thought, allowing himself this sliver of hope before the full might of his fear crashed into his fading mind.  Branches and bark and blood.  When the city fell, Rizzrack fled trees that walked, and fought, and killed.  Trees had shattered the gates and swarmed into the city.  Trees had crushed and thrashed and stomped the last that Augury Bay could muster in defense, and stalked the few fleeing refugees.  In addled silence Rizzrack unspooled the thick chain from the suit's arm, his hands quaking as he inspected each link and ran a trembling finger along the claw attached at its end.  The saw-suit was ready.\nWith his hand trembling he sparked the bladed machine to life.  Terror drove him, terror of what awaited him and of what he would have to face to have any hope of calming his mind.

Christened Bristleback by the drunken crowds, he waded into backroom brawls in every road tavern between Slom and Elze, until his exploits finally caught the eye of a barkeep in need of an enforcer. For a bit of brew, Bristleback was hired to collect tabs, keep the peace, and break the occasional leg or two (or five, in the case of one unfortunate web-hund).\nAfter indulging in a night of merriment during which bodily harm was meted out in equal parts upon both delinquent patrons and his own liver, Bristleback finally met his match. 'Your tusks offend me, sir,' he was heard to drunkenly slur to one particularly large fellow from the northern wastes whose bill had come due. What followed was a fight for the ages. A dozen fighters jumped in. No stool was left unbroken, and in the end, the impossible happened: the tab went unpaid. Over the weeks that followed, Bristleback's wounds healed, and his quills grew back; but an enforcer's honor can be a prickly thing. He paid the tab from his own coin, vowing to track down this northerner and extract redemption. And then he did something he'd never done before: he actually trained, and in so doing made a startling discovery about himself. A smile peeled back from his teeth as he flexed his quills.

There stood Ymir, the Tusk, the Terror from the Barrier, the Snowball from Cobalt, the only fighter to have bested the Bristled Bruiser in a fair fight, and now the last man standing in Wolfsden Tavern. What started as a simple bar bet of supremacy ended with four regulars, a blacksmith, and six of the Frost Brigade's best soldiers writhing against the shards and splinters of almost every bottle, mug, and chair in the building. The Tusk boasted and toasted his victory as he emptied his brew.\nNo sooner had the defeated regained consciousness than the cries for double-or-nothing rang out. The Tusk was pleased at the prospect, but none could think of a bet bigger than the one he just conquered. Horrified at the damage to his tavern and desperate to avoid another brawl, the barkeep had an idea. As skilled as he was, Ymir had never taken part in a real battle, never tested himself against the indiscriminate death and chaos of war.

"Elder Titan","Melee","Initiator - Disabler - Nuker - Durable","Well may you ask, 'How did this world take its form?' Why of all the worlds in creation, has this one its strange properties, its diverse and motley collection of creatures, cultures and lore? 'The answer,' One whispers, 'lies with the Titans.'\nThese original progenitors were there near the Beginning--if not actual witnesses to the creation, then born with it still echoing in their ears. Stamped with the earliest energies of the universe, they wished nothing more than to continue as creators themselves. Thus they bent to the task of shaping matter to their will: hammering and heating, bending and blasting. And when matter proved less challenging than they liked, they turned their tools upon themselves, reshaping their minds and reforging their spirits until they had become beings of great endurance. Reality itself became the ultimate object of their smithing. Yet, along the way, they sometimes erred. In cases of great ambition, mistakes are unavoidable.\nThe one we know as the Elder Titan was a great innovator, one who studied at the forge of creation. In honing his skills, he shattered something that could never be repaired, only thrown aside. He fell into his own broken world, a shattered soul himself. There he dwelt among the jagged shards and fissured planes, along with other lost fragments that had sifted down through the cracks in the early universe. And this is why the world we know resembles an isle of castaways, survivors of a wreck now long forgotten. Forgotten, that is, by all but the One who blames himself. He spends his time forever seeking a way to accomplish the repairs, that he might rejoin the parts of his broken soul, that we and the world alike might all be mended. This is the One we know as Elder Titan.","23 + 1.60","14 + 1.50","24 + 2.30","23 - 33","315","2.96","3","1","606","299","47-57","3","1800 / 800","150","900","15","1,218","590","79-89","6","1800 / 800","150","900","25","2,035","1,058","122-132","11","1800 / 800","150","900","5","Echo Stomp","Elder Titan and his Astral Spirit both stomp the ground, damaging and knocking nearby enemy units unconscious around their locations.

"Legion Commander","Melee","Carry - Disabler - Initiator - Durable - Nuker","They came without warning. Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound, and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count, wielding flame and foul sorcery, slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose. Of once-mighty Stonehall's military strength only the Bronze Legion, led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin, was near enough to answer the call of battle. They rode into their city, fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets, cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion: an ethereal rift within the city square, and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion.\nEnwrapped in a corrosive shimmer, the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade, cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil. Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast. It turned, smiling at her through a maze of teeth. Heedless of the battle raging around them, they charged one another.\nDeflecting blow after blow, the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them. Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her. The odds turned. The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly, a brutal thrust from the side, but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke. Blade scraped on blade, beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below, carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood. The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack, driving her blade through her foe's flesh into the stampeding heart within. With a scream that split the clouds above, the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish. The stygian portal wavered, the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared. The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel.\nThough victorious, the survivors saw little to celebrate: the city lay in ruins, and survivors were few. Fires continued to spread. Unfurling her banners of war, Tresdin gathered what allies she could. Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss, and damned be any who would dare stand in her way.","20 + 2.20","18 + 1.70","26 + 2.60","35 - 39","320","2.52","3","1","644","260","61-65","3","1800 / 800","150","900","15","1,336","660","97-101","6","1800 / 800","150","900","25","2,210","1,206","143-147","11","1800 / 800","150","900","4","Overwhelming Odds","Turns the enemies' numbers against them, dealing damage and granting you bonus movement speed per unit or per hero.

So would this dazzling cycle of birth and rebirth repeat until all skies hewn of Titan toil deigned to twinkle and shine.\nBy this ageless crucible the star that mortals would come to call Phoenix collapsed into being, and like its ancestors was thrust into an endless cosmos to find a place among its stellar brethren. Yet curiosity toward that which the dimming elders comfort in the darkness consumed the fledgling, and so over long cycles it inquired and studied. It learned that among worlds both whole and broken would soon stir a nexus of remarkable variety locked in an enduring conflict of cosmic consequence, a plane which would find itself in need of more influence than a dying sun's distant rays could provide.

"Anti-Mage","Melee","Carry - Escape - Nuker","The monks of Turstarkuri watched the rugged valleys below their mountain monastery as wave after wave of invaders swept through the lower kingdoms. Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their Unliving Lord's poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth survived--a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God's priesthood. With nothing but a few of Turstarkuri's prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God's magic users--but to put an end to magic altogether.","15 + 1.80","22 + 2.80","22 + 1.20","27 - 31","315","2.08","3","1","568","195","49-53","2","1800 / 800","150","N/A","15","887","523","88-92","8","1800 / 800","150","N/A","25","1,495","1,017","136-140","14","1800 / 800","150","N/A","4","Mana Break","Burns an opponent's mana on each attack.

Her parents were travelers in a caravan set upon by bandits, whose noisy slaughter of innocents roused the ire of the quiet Drow people. After the battle settled, the Drow discovered a small girl-child hiding in the ruined wagons, and agreed she could not be abandoned. Even as child, Traxex showed herself naturally adept at the arts they prized: Stealth, silence, subtlety. In spirit, if not in physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself as ugly. After all,  her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers. Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could approach.

The frozen ball melted in a flash of boiling heat, as below two forces enjoined in battle across the border of a narrow river. Thus freed from its icy stasis, the Morphling was born into conflict, an elemental power at one with the tides of the ocean, capricious and unconstrained. He entered the fight, instinctively taking the form of the first general who dared set foot across the water, and then struck him dead. As the motley warriors clashed, he shifted from form to form throughout the battle, instantly absorbing the ways of these strange creatures--now a footsoldier, now an archer, now the cavalryman--until, by the time the last soldier fell, Morphling had played every part.

For them, the quiet of spear fishing, and a family meal were all that a full life required. Yet war came for them nonetheless. Joining the able-bodied conscripts as they filed passed their homes, the humble lancer Azwraith vowed to bring peace to his kingdom, and in so doing, his people. Placed with his kin in the vanguard of the final assault against the Dread Magus Vorn, the cost to his fellows was absolute. As the charging force battled toward the fortress, Azwraith alone among his kind remained standing, and he alone was able to infiltrate the keep. Focused and infuriated by the slaughter of his brothers, Azwraith bested each of the wizard's deadly traps and conjured guardians. Soon the simple fisherman arrived at Vorn's tower sanctum. The pair dueled through the night, pike to staff, as chaos raged below, and with a deafening cry Azwraith pierced his enemy. But the wizard did not simply expire; he exploded into uncountable shards of light, penetrating his killer with power. As the dust settled and the smoke of combat began to clear, Azwraith found himself standing among a throng of his kin. Each seemed to be dressed as he was, each seemed armed as he was, and he could sense that each thought as he did. Aware that his allies were approaching, he willed these phantoms to hide themselves, and one by one they began to vanish into nothingness. As the soldiers came upon the sanctum, they found the warrior that had bested the wizard. When they approached their champion, the lancer vanished.

"Vengeful Spirit","Ranged","Support - Initiator - Disabler - Nuker - Escape","Even the most contented Skywrath is an ill-tempered creature, naturally inclined to seek revenge for the slightest insult. But Vengeful Spirit is the essence of vengeance. Once a proud and savage Skywrath scion, Shendelzare was first in succession for the Ghastly Eyrie until a sister's treachery robbed her of her birthright. Snared in an assassin's net, Shendelzare tore free only at the cost of her wings, limping away in the ultimate humiliation: On foot. With her wings broken, she knew the Skywrath would never accept her as ruler; and in the highest roost of the Eyrie, inaccessible except by winged flight, her sister was untouchable.

"Sniper","Ranged","Carry - Nuker","Kardel Sharpeye was born deep in the mountains of Knollen where, since time immemorial, Keen Folk have survived by hunting the strange, cliff-dwelling steepstalkers above their village, shooting them from a distance and collecting the carcasses where they fell. Sharpeye was among the best of these strange mountain keens for whom projectile weapons are but another appendage, and to shoot is as natural as to touch. \nOn his day of summoning, when he was to gain full standing in his village, Sharpeye took the ancient test: a single shot from the valley floor to strike a beast down from the cliffs. To miss was to be dishonored. With his entire village standing vigil, Sharpeye took his shot. A steepstalker fell; the crowd cheered.  But when the carcass was collected, the village grew silent, for the elders found that the bullet had pierced its glittering central eye then fallen to be clenched in the steepstalker's mandibles. This ominous sign was the literal opening of a dark prophecy, foretelling both greatness and exile for the gunman who made such a shot. Sharpeye the Sniper was thus, by his own skill, condemned to make his way apart from his people--and unwelcome back among them until he has fulfilled the remainder of the prophecy by attaining legendary stature on a field of battle.","15 + 2.60","21 + 2.50","16 + 1.70","15 - 21","290","1.94","3","1","454","195","36-42","2","1800 / 1100","550","3000","15","906","668","71-77","7","1800 / 1100","550","3000","25","1,609","1,266","116-122","13","1800 / 1100","550","3000","4","Shrapnel","Consumes a charge to launch a ball of shrapnel that showers the target area in explosive pellets.

Possessed of a scientific bent, she spent her early years engaged in meticulous study of nature's laws--peering into grimoires of magic and alchemy, recreating experiments from charred fragments of the Violet Archives, and memorizing observations of the Keen recordkeepers. Already quiet and secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects further reinforced her skills of stealth. Had she been less retiring, she might have become notorious among the guilds as a thief-scholar. Instead her investigations led her into far more obscure corners. As she devoted her furtive talents to unlocking the secrets of the universe, she instead unlocked a secret door that exists in nature itself: the entryway to the most Hidden Temple. The intelligences that waited beyond that portal, proved to be expecting her, and whatever mysteries they revealed in the moment of their discovery was nothing compared to the answers they held out to Lanaya should she continue in their service. She swore to protect the mysteries, but more to the point, in service to the Hidden Temple she satisfies her endless craving for understanding.

Now she was far from her homeland, driven half mad from starvation and months of wandering, her army long dead or worse.  As she stood at the edge of an ancient forest, a pair of glowing eyes spied on from an elder branch.  Something beautiful and deadly sought a meal in the wilting dusk.  Without a sound, it turned and left.  Fury overtook her.  Clutching a rust-eaten dagger, she charged after the beast determined to reclaim even a shred of her past glory, but her quarry would not be caught.  Three times she cornered the creature among the rocks and trees, and three times she pounced only to witness its fading shadow darting further into the woods.  Yet the full moon shone brightly, and the creature's trail was easy to follow.  Arriving in a clearing atop a high hill, the beast's massive feline form sat in the open, attentive and waiting.  When the woman brandished her dagger, the creature reared and roared and charged.  Death, it seemed, had come for her at long last in this strange place.  She stood, calm and ready.  A flash of movement, and the beast snatched the dagger from her hand before vanishing into the forest.  Stillness.  Hooded figures approached. In reverent tones they revealed that Selemene, Goddess of the Moon, had chosen her, had guided her, had tested her. Unwittingly she had endured the sacred rites of the Dark Moon, warriors of the Nightsilver Woods.\nShe was offered a choice: join the Dark Moon and pledge herself to the service of Selemene, or leave and never return. She did not hesitate. Embracing her absolution, she renounced her bloody past, and took up a new mantle as Luna of the Dark Moon, the dreaded Moon Rider, ruthless and ever-loyal guardian of the Nightsilver Woods.","16 + 1.85","18 + 3.30","15 + 2.20","26 - 32","335","3.52","3","1","435","208","44-50","4","1800 / 800","330","900","15","1,020","545","90-96","10","1800 / 800","330","900","25","1,818","1,045","143-149","17","1800 / 800","330","900","4","Lucent Beam","Calls a beam of lunar energy down upon an enemy, damaging and briefly stunning them.","Selemene smites those who encroach upon the Nightsilver Woods.","90/100/110/120","6","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,DAMAGE: 75 / 150 / 225 / 300,STUN DURATION: 0.8","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/luna_lucent_beam_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/ALMg8aRf7Xs?hd=1&rel=0","Moon Glaive","Empowers Luna's glaive, causing her attacks to bounce between enemy units.

"Gyrocopter","Ranged","Carry - Nuker - Disabler","After serving through a lifetime of wars, upheaval, riots, and revolutions, the brass figured Aurel had seen enough. But in addition to a few trinkets and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter, the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and money, he set to work building the device. As the years wore on and the remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight. As dusk settled in he set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris. Days later, when Aurel returned to his workshop, he set to work on yet another gyrocopter, this one capable of carrying a much heavier, more dangerous payload.","19 + 2.10","24 + 2.80","18 + 1.80","13 - 23","315","4.36","3","1","492","247","37-47","4","1800 / 800","365","3000","15","971","629","76-86","10","1800 / 800","365","3000","25","1,693","1,162","124-134","17","1800 / 800","365","3000","4","Rocket Barrage","Launches a salvo of rockets at nearby enemy units in a radius around the Gyrocopter.

Wise and just they were, and focused in their ways to seek an understanding of the natural order. The arch forces of nature saw this, and so sought the most learned among them. Wise old Sylla, clan justiciar and seer, stepped forward for his kin, and to him was given the Seed with these words: 'When all of the world has dimmed, when civilization has left these lands, when the world is slain and wracked by the endless deserts at the end of ages, plant the Seed.' As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind. He found himself able to project his very will into reality and, with some concentration, alter his own physical form as well. Yet subtle whispers and cruel ears brought word of the Seed and its power to other peoples, and a terrible war crashed upon the Bear Clan. As his ancestral home burned, Sylla took his burden and fled to the wild places. Ages passed, and time and myth forgot the Bear Clan, forgot Sylla and the Seed, forgot wondrous civilizations that rose and fell in Bear Clan's wake. For millenia Sylla has waited, waited for word from his deities, waited for peace to come to the ever warring realms, waited in exile and in secret for the end of all things and for the conclusion of his sacred commitment, preparing himself always to face and destroy whatever would dare threaten his purpose.","13 + 1.40","24 + 2.70","17 + 2.10","22 - 26","325","3.36","3","1","473","169","46-50","3","1800 / 800","550","900","15","1,032","424","84-88","9","1800 / 800","550","900","25","1,811","866","131-135","15","1800 / 800","550","900","6","Summon Spirit Bear","Summons a powerful Spirit Bear companion that can equip items.

In truth, these words are equal parts oath and enforceable covenant, for those who fall short of their duty are banished from the order.  To fail is to be other than Slithereen.\nOnce most highly esteemed of her race, Slithice for many years commanded a battalion of her fellows, using her formidable voice as her greatest weapon.  Powerful, sinuous, serpentine, she led her deadly Guard in defense of the Deep Ones, and the great wealth of the sunken cities.  But in the final battle of Crey, her forces were driven back by a marauding army of levianths intent on finding tribute for their god Maelrawn.  After the long and bloody onslaught, as the bodies were cleared from the sunken halls, a single jeweled chalice was found missing from the trove.  Of her hundred Guard, only a handful survived, but their bravery and sacrifice were of little consequence.  What mattered was that treasure was taken.  Honor destroyed.  And so Naga Siren was cast out.  Banished to search for the stolen chalice.  Though she might add a hundred times her weight to the golden trove, she is doomed to live apart until that day she returns that which was taken.

"Troll Warlord","Ranged","Carry - Pusher - Disabler - Durable","It's an easy thing to offend a troll. A prickly and contentious race, trolls thrive on argument and strife, missing no excuse to raise their voices in dispute. Males grow to maturity in subterranean chambers beneath their matriarch's domicile, feeding and amusing themselves while contributing nothing. Often they stay for years beyond the age of maturity, while the matriarch provides them with sustenance. When young trolls are finally pushed from their sub-chamber, they gather with others of their kind, forming roving gangs of malcontents who complain loudly about all manner of vexation.     \nAs much as trolls love to argue, imagine how rare it is for a troll to be driven from his own kind for being too difficult to get along with. Such was Jah'rakal's fate, a monger troll from deep in the Hoven. So deluded was he, so bitter and abrasive, that even other trolls found his company intolerable. After one particularly vitriolic outburst in which he claimed the lion's share of loot from their latest raid, his cohorts finally snapped. They turned on him, beat him with clubs, and drove him from the encampment. Enraged at his banishment, he returned the next day, armed with steel, and slew them all, one by one. He then swore a blood oath: he would ever after be a fighting force unto himself.

"Shadow Shaman","Ranged","Support - Pusher - Disabler - Nuker - Initiator","Born in the Bleeding Hills, Rhasta was just a starving youngling when picked up by a travelling con-man.  For two pins of copper, the old con-man would tell your fortune. For three, he'd castrate your pig, for five, he'd circumcise your sons. For a good meal, he'd don his shaman garb, read from his ancient books, and lay a curse upon your enemies. His strange new youngling, part hill troll, part...something else, worked as assistant and lent an air of the exotic to the con-man's trade. \nAlways one step ahead of cheated customers, one town ahead of a pursuing patronage, the two trekked across the blighted lands until one day the con-man realized that the little youngling could actually do what he only pretended at. His ward had a gift--a gift that customers valued. And so the youngling Rhasta was thrust before the crowds, and the trade-name Shadow Shaman was born. The two continued from town to town, conjuring for money as Shadow Shaman's reputation grew. Eventually, the pair's duplicitous past caught up with them, and they were ambushed by a mob of swindled ex-clients. The con-man was slain, and for the first time, Rhasta used his powers for darkness, massacring the attackers. He buried his beloved master, and now uses his powers to destroy any who would seek to do him harm.","21 + 3.00","16 + 1.60","21 + 1.80","26 - 33","285","1.24","3","1","549","273","47-54","1","1800 / 800","500","900","15","1,028","819","89-96","4","1800 / 800","500","900","25","1,750","1,469","139-146","9","1800 / 800","500","900","4","Ether Shock","Creates a cone of ethereal energy that strikes multiple enemy units.","Originally used to open shows with the travelling con-man, Rhasta's lightning display shocks adversaries in more ways than one.","95/105/135/160","8","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,TARGETS: 1 / 3 / 5 / 7,DAMAGE: 140 / 200 / 260 / 320","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/shadow_shaman_ether_shock_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/klelWIqMCVI?hd=1&rel=0","Hex","Transforms an enemy unit into a harmless creature, disabling their attacks and abilities.","Rhasta often ended performances by turning himself into a chicken - now, the humiliation is shared.","110/140/170/200","13","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,DURATION: 1.25 / 2 / 2.75 / 3.5","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/shadow_shaman_voodoo_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/QNp_Qa0FT5k?hd=1&rel=0","Shackles","CHANNELED - Magically binds an enemy unit so that it cannot move or attack, while dealing damage over time.","A self-defense incantation, Rhasta developed shackles after his master was slain in the Bleeding Hills.","140/150/160/170","10","ABILITY: Channeled, Unit Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,TOTAL DAMAGE: 120 / 200 / 280 / 360,MAX DURATION: 2.75 / 3.5 / 4.25 / 5","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/shadow_shaman_shackles_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/Wu47XDHlzq0?hd=1&rel=0","Mass Serpent Ward","Summons 10 Serpent Wards to attack enemy units and structures.

It pained her to leave the world bereft, for the sprouts had not yet broken through the soil--and they would be tender and vulnerable to every sort of harm. She found in her seed pouch one last seed that she had missed in the sowing. She spoke a single word into the seed and swallowed it as she fell. Her vast body decomposed throughout the long winter, becoming the humus that would feed the seedlings in the spring. And on the morning of the vernal equinox, before the rest of the forest had begun to wake, that last seed ripened and burst in an instant.

"Chen","Ranged","Support - Jungler - Pusher","Born in the godless Hazhadal Barrens, Chen came of age among the outlaw tribes who eked out an existence in the shimmering heat of the desert.  Using an ancient form of animal enthrallment, Chen's people husbanded the hardy desert locuthi, a stunted species of burrowing dragon that melted desert sands into tubes of glass where twice-a-year rains collected.  Always on the edge of starvation and thirst, fighting amongst their neighbors and each other, Chen's clan made the mistake, one fateful day, of ambushing the wrong caravan. \nIn the vicious battle that followed, Chen's clan was outmatched.  The armored Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked and died in waves.  With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perished--or would have. Defeated, on his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the blade.

He was the prophesied one, the culmination of two-hundred years of careful pairings, a war-mage who would bring glory to the order, and destruction to their sworn enemies, The Knights of the Fold. \nRaised with other young mages in a hidden cantonment among the hills of the Hazhadal barrens, the order's preceptors waited for Nortrom's abilities to manifest. While the other students honed their talents with fire, or ice, or incantatory spells, Nortrom sat silent and talentless, unable to cast so much as a hex. As the day of final testing approached, he still hadn't found his magic. In disgust, the preceptors berated him, while the children laughed. 'You are no mage,' the head of the order declared. Still, Nortrom did not slink away. He entered the day of testing and faced down the young mages who had mocked him. And then his preceptors learned a valuable lesson: a lack of magic can be the greatest magic of all. Nortrom silenced the young mages one by one and defeated them in single combat, until he alone stood as champion of the Aeol Drias, in fulfillment of the prophecy.","27 + 2.50","22 + 3.00","17 + 2.20","16 - 30","295","2.08","3","1","473","351","43-57","2","1800 / 800","600","1000","15","1,058","806","78-92","8","1800 / 800","600","1000","25","1,856","1,391","123-137","15","1800 / 800","600","1000","4","Arcane Curse","Curses the target area, causing enemy heroes to take damage and slowing their movement speed.

In his natural state, an ogre is supremely incapable of doing or deciding anything. Clothed in dirt, he sometimes finds himself accidentally draped in animal skins after eating lanekill. Not an especially social creature, he is most often found affectionately consorting with the boulders or tree-stumps he has mistaken for kin (a factor that may explain the ogre's low rate of reproduction).  However, once every generation or so, the ogre race is blessed with the birth of a two-headed Ogre Magi, who is immediately given the traditional name of Aggron Stonebreak, the name of the first and perhaps only wise ogre in their line's history. With two heads, Ogre Magi finds it possible to function at a level most other creatures manage with one. And while the Ogre Magi will win no debates (even with itself), it is graced with a divine quality known as Dumb Luck--a propensity for serendipitous strokes of fortune which have allowed the ogre race to flourish in spite of enemies, harsh weather, and an inability to feed itself.  It's as if the Goddess of Luck, filled with pity for the sadly inept species, has taken Ogre Magi under her wing. And who could blame her?

"Rubick","Ranged","Support - Disabler - Nuker","Any mage can cast a spell or two, and a few may even study long enough to become a wizard, but only the most talented are allowed to be recognized as a Magus. Yet as with any sorcerer's circle, a sense of community has never guaranteed competitive courtesy.\nAlready a renowned duelist and scholar of the grander world of sorcery, it had never occurred to Rubick that he might perhaps be Magus material until he was in the midst of his seventh assassination attempt. As he casually tossed the twelfth of a string of would-be killers from a high balcony, it dawned on him how utterly unimaginative the attempts on his life had become. Where once the interruption of a fingersnap or firehand might have put a cheerful spring in his step, it had all become so very predictable. He craved greater competition. Therefore, donning his combat mask, he did what any wizard seeking to ascend the ranks would do: he announced his intention to kill a Magus.\nRubick quickly discovered that to threaten one Magus is to threaten them all, and they fell upon him in force. Each antagonist's spell was an unstoppable torrent of energy, and every attack a calculated killing blow. But very soon something occurred that Rubick's foes found unexpected: their arts appeared to turn against them. Inside the magic maelstrom, Rubick chuckled, subtly reading and replicating the powers of one in order to cast it against another, sowing chaos among those who had allied against him. Accusations of betrayal began to fly, and soon the sorcerers turned one upon another without suspecting who was behind their undoing.\nWhen the battle finally drew to a close, all were singed and frozen, soaked and cut and pierced. More than one lay dead by an ally's craft. Rubick stood apart, sore but delighted in the week's festivities. None had the strength to argue when he presented his petition of assumption to the Hidden Council, and the Insubstantial Eleven agreed as one to grant him the title of Grand Magus.","27 + 2.40","14 + 1.60","19 + 1.50","17 - 27","290","0.96","3","1","511","351","44-54","1","1800 / 800","600","1125","15","910","788","78-88","4","1800 / 800","600","1125","25","1,575","1,360","122-132","9","1800 / 800","600","1125","5","Telekinesis","Rubick uses his telekinetic powers to lift the enemy into the air briefly and then hurls them back at the ground.

Constantly under assault from both seasonal storms and encroachment from civilized kingdoms to the South, the upland Oglodi have for centuries struggled to subsist atop the endless tablelands.  They are the fractured remnant of a once-great civilization, a fallen tribe, their stormcraft strange and inscrutable, cobbled together from scraps of lost knowledge which even they no longer fully understand.  For those on the high plain, weather has become a kind of religion, worshiped as both the giver and taker of life.  But the electrical storms that bring life-sustaining rains arrive at a cost, and many are the charred and smoking corpses left in their wake.  \nAlthough small for his kind, Disruptor is fearless, and driven by an insatiable curiosity.  As a youth, while still unblooded and without a stryder, he explored the ruins of the ancestral cities, searching through collapsed and long-moldering libraries, rummaging through rusting manufactories.  He took what he needed and returned to his tribe.  Adapting a coil of ancient design, he harnessed the power of electrical differential and now calls down the thunder whenever he wishes.  Part magic, part craftsmanship, his coils hold in their glowing plates the power of life and death--a power wielded with precision against the landed castes to the South, and any interlopers who cross into ancient Oglodi lands.","22 + 2.50","15 + 1.40","19 + 1.90","27 - 31","300","1.1","3","1","511","286","49-53","1","1800 / 800","600","1200","15","1,016","741","84-88","4","1800 / 800","600","1200","25","1,757","1,326","129-133","9","1800 / 800","600","1200","4","Thunder Strike","Repeatedly strikes the targeted unit with lightning.

"Skywrath Mage","Ranged","Support - Nuker - Disabler","A highly placed mage in the court of the Ghastly Eyrie, Dragonus lives a troubled existence. Sworn by birth to protect whoever sits within the Nest of Thorns, he hates the current Skywrath queen with all his soul. As a youth, high-born, he was a friend and companion to the eldest Skywrath princess, Shendelzare, first in line for the Nest. He had loved her warmly and unshakably, but as his studies took hold, his mind turned to arcane learning and the mastery of Skywrath sorcery.\nObsessed with matters aetherial, he missed the mundane signs of courtly treachery that hinted at a plot against Shendelzare, and lost his chance to foil it. When the court was shaken by a swift and violent coup, he emerged from his studies to discover his oldest and dearest friend had been lost to him. The Nest of Thorns now belonged to Shendelzare's ruthless younger sister, and Dragonus could do nothing. The magic of the Skywrath Mage serves only the sworn protector of the Skywrath scion, so to act against the Nest would render him helpless. He clings to his post, believing it to be the best hope of one day restoring his true love to her rightful place. Meanwhile, his secret is known only to the goddess Scree'auk, whose magic it was transformed Shendelzare from a crippled physical creature into an embodiment of pure vengeful energy.\nWhile he dreams of restoring his beloved queen to the Ghastly Eyrie, he dreams even more desperately of restoring Shendelzare herself to a fully healed physical form. The duplicity of his role at court tortures him, for he is a noble and good-hearted creature; but the worst torture of all is imagining the hatred that Vengeful Spirit must hold in her heart for him.","27 + 3.60","13 + 0.80","19 + 1.50","12 - 22","325","-0.18","3","1","511","351","39-49","-0","1800 / 800","600","1000","15","910","1,006","89-99","1","1800 / 800","600","1000","25","1,575","1,734","145-155","5","1800 / 800","600","1000","4","Arcane Bolt","Skywrath Mage launches a slow-moving bolt of arcane magic, dealing damage to an enemy unit based on Skywrath Mage's intelligence.","Within the Ghastly Eyrie's endless intrigue, only the clever and calm can hope to survive.","70/70/70/70","5/4/3/2","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,BASE DAMAGE: 60 / 80 / 100 / 120","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/skywrath_mage_arcane_bolt_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/TFjMorJ3PHU?hd=1&rel=0","Concussive Shot","Skywrath Mage sets off a long range shot that hits the closest hero within a long range.

"Oracle","Ranged","Support - Nuker - Disabler - Escape","Ascendants to the Great Seat of Cymurri had for ages imported their Oracles exclusively from the Ivory Incubarium, high in the hollow peaks of the Zealot's Range, with a downpayment made at the time of the embryo's conception and the balance surrendered on delivery of a mature, well-trained prophet to the Gate of the Graven King.\nRaised by same Pallid Sybils who bred and birthed them, all sanctioned Oracles were anchored by their physical form to the world we most of us share; meanwhile, their souls roamed far afield, barely bound by the airiest astral umbilicus. From such cosmic roamings the prophets would return, speaking words of fire with tongues of flesh. Their mystic utterances were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors, who found in them visions of the future, diplomatic advice, all the supernatural ammunition the line of Graven Kings needed to secure victory in every campaign, whether in the court or on the battlefield. Thus it went for generations, the Graventome's pages filling with the names of triumphant kings and the new domains they had acquired. So it went, that is, until the particular Oracle named Nerif arrived to serve the very last of the stone-helmed kings. \nFrom the first, Nerif's prophecies were unusual. They seemed not merely to portend the future, but to shape it. The weird soothsayer croaked out advice no one had requested, and suddenly the Cymurri found themselves immersed in conflicts with newfound enemies. The Advisors, sensing a threat to their power, were quick to pin these unwelcome developments on the latest Oracle. They demanded his removal, petitioning the Sybils to reclaim their defective prophet and replace him with a worthy substitute. But Nerif described an ominous dream of the Incubarium's destruction, and within hours came news of the ancient school's destruction in a catastrophic avalanche. Fearing the same fate as the Pallid Sybils, the Advisors withdrew to their counsel chambers, suddenly anxious to avoid the Oracle's notice. \nThe Graven King, however, was a creature of great practicality. He doubted the commitment of his overprudent Advisors. An Oracle of such rarity, he reasoned, ought be used as a weapon to enlarge his domain. He therefore demoted his timid counselors and stationed Nerif at his side. With only a blunt understanding of Nerif's talent, he boldly stated the outcomes he desired, and coaxed Nerif into uttering his wishes as prophecy. \nAt first, all was well. The Last Graven King boasted that by adopting Fate's pet, he had made a plaything of Fate itself. He should have taken it as a warning then when, on the eve of his invasion of the Unsated Satrap's realm, he attempted to coerce a prediction of certain victory from his Oracle, only to hear Nerif quietly mutter, 'It could go either way.' No firmer statement could he force from Nerif's lips. Still, the King was confident in his army. The Satrapy was landlocked, poorly armed, and shut off from all possible allies. He took 'It could go either way' to indicate that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his plan.\nOf course, we now know that he should have taken the sayer's words more literally. Even with careful study of the Annotated Annals of If, what happened on the field before the Unsated Satrap's palace is almost impossible to visualize. It appears that in the midst of the carnage, the battle began to bifurcate. At each pivotal moment, reality calved and broke into bits. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also stood sure-footed, forging onward to fight. Their minds also split; the warriors found themselves both dead and alive, existent and non-existent. Victory and defeat were partitioned, so that each separate outcome was experienced in simultaneity by both armies. The universe became a hall of mirrors, with all the mirrors endlessly shattering.\nThe immediate effect on both parties was insanity. Unable to comprehend the state of being both triumphant and defeated, the Graven King's mind dispersed into motes of madness. The naive Satrap fared no better. The opposing paired realities continued to split and split again, echoing into infinite histories, all of them populated by a bewildered populace that soon lost the ability to feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner. \nLong before the repercussions had played out, however, Cymurri's wary Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever. It was, of course, too late for them. And may well be for us.","23 + 2.90","15 + 1.70","18 + 1.90","16 - 22","305","2.1","3","1","492","299","39-45","2","1800 / 800","620","900","15","997","827","80-86","5","1800 / 800","620","900","25","1,738","1,464","129-135","11","1800 / 800","620","900","4","Fortune's End","CHANNELED - Gathers Oracle's power into a bolt of scouring energy that, when released, damages, stops movement, and purges enemies of buffs in an area around the target.

Nor does Toterin. Or even Trapper Town. In fact, if one were to track the history of Techies Demolitions they might notice that shortly after Techies appear, towns tend to disappear.\nLike every inevitable disaster surrounding Techies, the obliteration of Dredger's Bight began with an invention. Tasked with designing a safer way of detonating explosives in the mines beneath the city, pyrotechnic prodigies Squee, Spleen, and Spoon developed their most outlandish creation yet: a button which, when pressed, would trigger a distant device to spark a fuse.\nOvereager to test their invention, the trio stuffed barrel after barrel with flamesalt explosives, piling every corner of their tiny workshop high with the newly developed remote bombs. From this stockpile they plucked a single payload, burying it in a far away field. As they cowered in a ditch, Spleen pressed the detonator button. Yet after a moment, nothing happened. Confused, he stood up, pressing his button again and again until, finally, an explosion tore a hole in the field. Elated, Squee and Spleen turned toward home just as a massive wave of sound and force arrived to knock them over.\nBewildered, their ears ringing from the unexpected blast, they gathered in the dingy miasma to see a smoking ruin where their workshop once stood. Chunks of wood and stone continued to fall as the yawning crater before them slowly deepened into an expanding pit. The whole of Dredger's Bight shuddered, and then gradually started to slide into the mines below as its panicked residents fled.\nSitting at the edge of their sinking home they grinned and giggled, as giddy at the possibilities as they were oblivious to the scorn of their former neighbors. They wondered only one thing: how could they trigger an even bigger blast?","22 + 2.90","14 + 1.30","17 + 2.00","7 - 9","270","6.96","3","1","473","286","29-31","7","1800 / 800","700","900","15","1,005","814","70-72","10","1800 / 800","700","900","25","1,765","1,451","119-121","14","1800 / 800","700","900","6","Land Mines","Plant an invisible mine that explodes when an enemy steps near.

But eventually he learned that he had been deluded... that bone itself could perish. Deeply mistrustful of flesh, he sought a more permanent way of extending his reign, and at last settled on pursuit of wraith energy, a form of pure spirit given off by certain dark souls at death. Should he infuse himself with Wraith Essence, he thought he might create a body as luminous and eternal as his ego. On the millennial solstice known as Wraith-Night, he submitted to a rite of transformation, compelling his subjects to harvest enough souls to fuel his ambition for immortality.

He shared his cell with a gibbering creature known as N'aix, a thief cursed by the Vile Council with longevity, so that its life-sentence for theft and cozening might be as punishing as possible. Over the years, its chains had corroded, along with its sanity; N'aix retained no memory of its former life and no longer dreamt of escape. Seeing a perfect vessel for his plans, the wizard wove a spell of Infestation and cast his life-force into N'aix's body, intending to compel N'aix to sacrifice itself in a frenzy of violence while the mage returned to his body and crept away unnoticed. Instead, the wizard found his mind caught in a vortex of madness so powerful that it swept away his plans and shattered his will. Jarred to consciousness by the sudden infusion of fresh life, N'aix woke from its nightmare of madness and obeyed the disembodied voice that filled its skull, which had only the one thought: To escape. In that moment Lifestealer was born. The creature cast its mind into dungeon guards and soldiers, compelling them to open locks and cut down their companions, opening an unobstructed path to freedom while feeding on their lives. Lifestealer still wears the broken shackles as a warning that none may hold him, but on the inside remains a prisoner.

Before the Fall, as the King's wants grew strange, and his court grew crowded with sorcerers and charlatans, the house of Ambry was the first to rise against the avarice of the throne. No longer willing to pay homage and fealty, they instead sent six-thousand swords into the capital, where they were wiped out in the Massacre of the Apostates. And then came the teeth behind the old truth: When you strike a king's neck, you had better take his head. Enraged by the betrayal, the king exterminated the vast Ambry bloodline, sparing only the lord of the house and his youngest son, Banehallow. Before all the royal court, with the disgraced lord chained to the ornate marble floor, the King bade his magicians transform the boy into a wolf so that he might tear out his own father's throat. 'Do this,' the king said, 'so that Lord Ambry will understand the bite of betrayal.' Powerful magic was invoked, and the child was transformed. But though his body was changed, his spirit remained intact, and instead of biting the exposed neck of his father, he attacked his handlers, tearing them to pieces. A dozen of the King's knights perished under the wolf's teeth before they managed to drive it off into the night. Lord Ambry laughed from his chains even as the King ran him through with a sword.

"Magnus","Melee","Initiator - Disabler - Nuker - Escape","The master-smiths of Mt. Joerlak agree on only a single point: that the horn of a magnoceros is more precious than any alloy. And of all such horns, the largest and sharpest belongs to the beast they call Magnus. For half a generation, Magnus took easy sport goring hunters come to claim the treasures of his kin. Each time he would return to his cave with hooves and horns stained red, until his Matriarch urged him and all their kin to seek refuge to the north beyond the shadow of the mountain. But Magnus scoffed, having never failed to defend his people. The magnoceroi would stay, he decided, for a magnoceros does not believe in chance... nor does it ever change its mind. But when Mt. Joerlak erupted without warning, and half his kin perished in the fire and ash, Magnus changed his mind after all. The survivors pushed north, until they reached a blockade watched over by a hundred hunters armed with bow and steel. Magnus expected no less. He led his fiercest brothers and sisters in a charge against their enemies, and fought with a ferocity matched only by the fire-spewing mountain at his back. Meanwhile the magnoceros elders, mothers, and calves vanished into the drifts. The master-smiths are divided about what happened next. Some say Magnus reunited with his kin, while others claim he suffered mortal injuries and expired alongside the body of his Matriarch. Neither theory is correct. Magnus did vow to rejoin his kin...but only after seeking out those responsible for the eruption of Mt. Joerlak and watching them die upon his horn, for a magnoceros does not believe in chance.","19 + 1.65","15 + 2.50","21 + 2.90","32 - 44","315","4.1","3","1","549","247","53-65","4","1800 / 800","150","900","15","1,320","547","94-106","9","1800 / 800","150","900","25","2,251","1,022","143-155","15","1800 / 800","150","900","4","Shockwave","Magnus sends out a wave of force, damaging enemy units in a line.","Mt.

"Abaddon","Melee","Support - Carry - Durable","The Font of Avernus is the source of a family's strength, a crack in primal stones from which vapors of prophetic power have issued for generations. Each newborn of the cavernous House Avernus is bathed in the black mist, and by this baptism they are given an innate connection to the mystic energies of the land. They grow up believing themselves fierce protectors of their lineal traditions, the customs of the realm--but what they really are protecting is the Font itself. And the motives of the mist are unclear.\nWhen the infant Abaddon was bathed in the Font, they say something went awry. In the child's eyes there flared a light of comprehension that startled all present and set the sacerdotes to whispering. He was raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took--to train in war, that in times of need he might lead the family's army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist. He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist.\nThere was bitterness within the House Avernus--elders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his responsibilities. But all such accusations stopped when Abaddon rode into battle, and they saw how the powers of the mist had given him mastery over life and death beyond those of any lord the House had ever known.","21 + 2.00","17 + 1.50","23 + 2.70","32 - 42","310","1.38","3","1","587","273","55-65","1","1800 / 800","150","900","15","1,305","637","93-103","4","1800 / 800","150","900","25","2,198","1,157","140-150","9","1800 / 800","150","900","4","Mist Coil","Abaddon releases a coil of deathly mist that can damage an enemy unit or heal a friendly unit at the cost of some of Abaddon's health.","A mysterious vapor from the Font of Avernus now infuses the breath of Abaddon, who releases it at will.","50/60/70/80","4.50","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Heroes,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: Yes,SELF DAMAGE: 75 / 100 / 125 / 150,DAMAGE/HEAL: 100 / 150 / 200 / 250","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/abaddon_death_coil_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/stcWsFoEfag?hd=1&rel=0","Aphotic Shield","Summons dark energies around an ally unit, creating a shield that absorbs a set amount of damage before expiring.

"Venomancer","Ranged","Support - Nuker - Initiator - Pusher - Disabler","In the Acid Jungles of Jidi Isle, poison runs in the veins and bubbles in the guts of every creature that scuttles, climbs or swoops between fluorescent vines dripping with caustic sap. Yet even in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer--but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter--one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons--and new deaths to bring.","17 + 1.80","22 + 2.60","18 + 1.85","19 - 21","285","3.08","3","1","492","221","41-43","3","1800 / 800","450","900","15","984","549","77-79","8","1800 / 800","450","900","25","1,716","1,043","123-125","15","1800 / 800","450","900","4","Venomous Gale","Launches a ball of venom in a line, poisoning enemy units so that they take both initial damage and damage over time, as well as suffering slowed movement.

Once a sworn protector of the Hoven lands, Clinkz earned a reputation for his skill with a bow. In the three-hundredth year of the king-mage, the demon Maraxiform rose from sixth hell to lay claim to the forest. In response, the king-mage decreed an unbreakable spell: to any who slew the demon would be granted Life Without End.\nUnaware of the spell, Clinkz waded into battle, defending his lands against the demon's fiery onslaught. Clinkz drove Maraxiform back to the gates of sixth-hell itself, where on that fiery threshold the two locked in a mortal conflict. Grievously wounded, the demon let out a blast of hellfire as Clinkz loosed his final arrow. The arrow struck the demon true as hellfire poured out across the land, lighting the black pools and burning Clinkz alive at the instant of the demon's death. Thus, the mage's spell took effect at the very moment of the archer's conflagration, preserving him in this unholy state, leaving him a being of bones and rage, caught in the very act of dying, carrying hell's breath with him on his journey into eternity.","16 + 1.55","22 + 3.30","15 + 1.60","15 - 21","300","2.08","3","1","435","208","37-43","2","1800 / 800","640","900","15","861","490","83-89","9","1800 / 800","640","900","25","1,545","952","136-142","16","1800 / 800","640","900","4","Strafe","Clinkz attacks with a barrage of arrows.

In a later age, the Vizier of Greed, Ptholopthales, erected his lodestone ziggurat on the slopes of the dead volcano, knowing that any looters who sought his magnetic wealth must survive the spider-haunted passages. After millennia of maternal peace, Black Arachnia found herself beset by a steady trickle of furfeet and cutpurses, bold knights and noble youths--all of them delicious, certainly, and yet tending to create a less than nurturing environment for her innocent offspring. Tiring of the intrusions, she paid a visit to Ptholopthales; and when he proved unwilling to discuss a compromise, she wrapped the Vizier in silk and set him aside to be the centerpiece of a special birthday feast. Unfortunately, the absence of the Magnetic Ziggurat's master merely emboldened a new generation of intruders. When one of her newborns was trodden underfoot by a clumsy adventurer, she reached the end of her silken rope. Broodmother headed for the surface, declaring her intent to rid the world of each and every possible invader, down to the last Hero if necessary, until she could ensure her nursery might once more be a safe and wholesome environment for her precious spiderspawn.","18 + 2.00","18 + 2.20","17 + 2.50","26 - 32","295","2.52","3","1","473","234","44-50","3","1800 / 800","150","900","15","1,138","598","75-81","7","1800 / 800","150","900","25","1,993","1,118","117-123","13","1800 / 800","150","900","4","Spawn Spiderlings","Broodmother injects her young into an enemy unit, dealing damage.

"Weaver","Ranged","Carry - Escape","The fabric of creation needs constant care, lest it grow tattered; for when it unravels, whole worlds come undone. It is the work of the Weavers to keep the fabric tight, to repair worn spots in the mesh of reality. They also defend from the things that gnaw and lay their eggs in frayed regions, whose young can quickly devour an entire universe if the Weavers let their attention lapse. Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keeping one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain--to weave worlds of his own devising.  He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to do was tear apart this old world at the seams.","15 + 1.80","14 + 2.50","15 + 1.50","41 - 51","290","0.96","3","1","435","195","55-65","1","1800 / 800","425","900","15","834","523","90-100","6","1800 / 800","425","900","25","1,499","1,017","135-145","12","1800 / 800","425","900","4","The Swarm","Weaver launches a swarm of 12 young Weavers that latch on any enemy unit in their path, attacking and reducing armor until it is killed.","Skitskurr opens a gap in the space time fabric, allowing young Weavers to slip through and aid him in combat.","70/80/90/100","35/30/25/20","ABILITY: Point Target,DAMAGE TYPE: Physical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: Yes,ATTACK DAMAGE: 20,ATTACK FREQUENCY: 1.25 / 1.1 / 0.95 / 0.8,COUNT: 12 / 12 / 12 / 12,ARMOR REDUCTION: 1 / 1 / 1 / 1,DURATION: 16,ATTACKS TO DESTROY: 8 / 8 / 8 / 8","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/weaver_the_swarm_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/YfngG2WLpfc?hd=1&rel=0","Shukuchi","Weaver shifts out of visibility, gaining the ability to move at maximum speed through physical units--doing harm to any enemies it passes through.","As the Weavers worked in the fabric of creation, small wormholes allowed them to slip through time to better work their craft.","60/60/60/60","12/10/8/6","ABILITY: No Target,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,DAMAGE: 75 / 100 / 125 / 150,RADIUS: 175 / 175 / 175 / 175,FADE TIME: 0.25 / 0.25 / 0.25 / 0.25,DURATION: 4 / 4 / 4 / 4","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/weaver_shukuchi_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/d5tRF1b5L5E?hd=1&rel=0","Geminate Attack","Allows Weaver to dispatch two attacks at once.","Skitskurr's relationship with time is somewhat variable, causing his actions to be witnessed - and felt - more than once.","","6/5/4/3","ABILITY: Passive,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: Yes,","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/weaver_geminate_attack_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/UGW_dID1W5c?hd=1&rel=0","Time Lapse","Weaver warps backward to whatever position it was in five seconds earlier--regaining the HP and mana from that time.

In this dark mirror of reality, demons are sentenced to gaze eternally into the twisted reflection of their own souls.

"Arc Warden","Ranged","Carry - Escape - Nuker","Before the beginning of all, there existed a presence: a primordial mind, infinite, awesome, and set to inscrutable purpose. As the universe thundered into being, this mind was fragmented and scattered. Two among its greater fragments--who would come to be named Radiant and Dire--found themselves locked in vicious opposition, and began twisting all of creation to serve their conflict.\nAs war and cataclysm threatened the nascent cosmos, the will of a third fragment made itself known. Naming itself Zet, this intellect sought to resolve the disharmony and return all to perfect unity. Appalled by its kin's conflicting nature, Zet gathered the sum of its power. In a sudden flash, it overwhelmed its siblings, and fused the warring aspects into a stellar sphere before hurling them into the darkness to orbit a nondescript world. Harmony was restored, though only the barest fraction of Zet's strength remained. Setting its gaze on the prison, Zet chose to use its weakened power to serve as watchful warden until time's end. For uncounted aeons, this vigil stood.\nLife flourished upon the world below, oblivious to the dangers imprisoned within the softly glowing moon, or of Zet's struggles to contain them. As the captives' eternal clash reverberated within, the surface of the prison shuddered, over time beginning to crack. Ultimately, Zet's depleted power proved insufficient to contain the breach, and at last the moon was shattered. The prison's ancient inhabitants had escaped to sow their conflict anew.\nFlung to the farthest reaches by the prison's explosion, Zet was transformed by the dissonant energies of its former captives. No longer of single form and thought, its presence had become split among many--some lesser, some greater--each connected by a fleeting arc of consciousness. Struggling to suppress its own disunity, Zet sped toward the burgeoning conflict of its siblings, bending its fractured wills toward a singular conclusion: the aspects of the primordial mind must be made to reunite, or all must be destroyed lest the conflict spread further...","24 + 2.60","15 + 1.80","24 + 2.30","29 - 39","295","0.1","3","1","606","312","44-54","0","1800 / 800","625","900","15","1,218","785","69-79","4","1800 / 800","625","900","25","2,035","1,383","107-117","9","1800 / 800","625","900","4","Flux","Infuses a lone enemy unit with swirling, volatile energy, slowing its movement speed and dealing damage over time.

He only fell for a year or so before an outcrop snagged him. There he rested, dead but undecaying, until the geomancer Anhil thought to verify the legend of the supposedly bottomless Black Pool. Anhil's plumbline snarled with the ropes that bound the drowned magician, and up he hauled an unexpected prize. Thinking that by rendering the dead undead, he could question the Lich about the properties of the pool, he removed the bindings and commenced a simple rite of resurrection. Even the descendants of Ethreain's enemies were long forgotten by time, so there were none to warn Anhil against imprudence.

In truth, Enigma is a mystery for whom the only true biography is description: he is a universal force, a consumer of worlds. He is a being of the void, at times corporeal, other times ethereal. A beast between the planes. \nThere are stories that say he was once a great alchemist who tried to unlock the secrets of the universe and was cursed for his arrogance. Other legends tell that he is an ancient being of strange gravity, the abyss personified--a twisted voice from out the original darkness, before the first light in the universe.

While others of the order went out to succor the ill, the newly ordained cardinal secluded himself within the Cathedral of Rumusque, busily scheming to acquire the property of dying nobles, promising them spiritual rewards if they signed over their terrestrial domains. As the plague receded to a few stubborn pockets, his behavior came to the attention of the greater order, which found him guilty of heresy and sentenced him to serve in the plague ward, ensorcelled with spells that would ensure him a slow and lingering illness. But they had not counted on his natural immunity. Rotund'jere caught the pox, but instead of dying, found it feeding his power, transforming him into a veritable plague-mage, a Pope of Pestilence.

However, so often did his investigations trigger the wrath of protector entities, that he finally found it necessary to master the arts of magic. He bent himself to learning sorcery with the same thorough obsessiveness that marked his quest for incunabula, becoming the most powerful Warlock of the Academy in less time than most practitioners required to complete a course of undergraduate work. Almost as an afterthought, he carved a staff of Dreadwood and summoned into it a captive spirit from the Outer Hells.

In a less prominent political figure, such desires might be considered unwise, but in a monarch of his stature, to satisfy such thirsts would have threatened the virtue of the Divine Throne itself. Therefore he turned to his dungeon full of demonologists, promising freedom to whoever could summon a personal succubus of torment and bind it entirely to his service. The creature who arrived, Akasha by name, visited upon him such exquisite torments that he named her his Secret Queen, and he began to spend all his spare moments submitting to her clever torments--eventually abdicating all his responsibilities in his pursuit of the painful pleasures that only she could bring. Queen of Pain could bring him to the brink of death, but she was rune-bound to keep him alive. At last the King's neglect of state brought on an uprising. He was dragged from his chamber and hurled from the Tower of Invocations, and at the moment of death, Queen of Pain was let loose into the world, freed from servitude--freed to visit her sufferings on anyone she deigned to notice.","24 + 2.50","18 + 2.00","16 + 1.70","25 - 33","295","1.52","3","1","454","312","49-57","2","1800 / 800","550","1500","15","906","767","84-92","5","1800 / 800","550","1500","25","1,609","1,352","129-137","11","1800 / 800","550","1500","4","Shadow Strike","Hurls a poisoned dagger which deals large initial damage, and then deals damage over time.

But after years of inquiring on behalf of others, she began to seek clues on her own fate. When death refused to yield its secrets, she tried to buy them with her life. But the ultimate price proved insufficient. Death disgorged her again and again, always holding back its deepest mysteries. Her jealousy grew. Others could die for eternity--why not she? Why must she alone be cast back on the shores of life with such tiresome regularity? Why was she not worthy of the one thing all other living creatures took for granted? Still, she would not be discouraged. Each time she returned from the grave, she brought a bit of death back with her. Wraiths followed her like fragments of her shattered soul; her blood grew thin and ectoplasmic; the feasting creatures of twilight took her for their kin.. She gave a little of her life with every demise, and it began to seem as if her end was in sight. With her dedication to death redoubled, and no client other than herself, Krobelus threw herself ever more fervently into death's abyss, intent on fulfilling the one prophecy that eluded her: That someday the Death Prophet would return from death no more.","23 + 3.00","14 + 1.40","17 + 1.90","24 - 36","310","2.96","3","1","473","299","47-59","3","1800 / 800","600","1000","15","978","845","89-101","6","1800 / 800","600","1000","25","1,719","1,495","139-151","10","1800 / 800","600","1000","4","Crypt Swarm","Sends a swarm of winged beasts to savage enemy units in front of Death Prophet.","Krobelus' many trips to the grave gather a flock of the damned.","105/120/140/165","8/7/6/5","ABILITY: Unit Target, Point Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,DAMAGE: 75 / 150 / 225 / 300,RANGE: 810 / 810 / 810 / 810","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/death_prophet_carrion_swarm_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/z_uGWWazyqg?hd=1&rel=0","Silence","Prevents enemy units in a target area from casting spells.","Peering into the veil of her opponent's demise, Krobelus sees a silent future.","80/80/80/80","15/14/13/12","ABILITY: Point Target,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,RADIUS: 425,DURATION: 3 / 4 / 5 / 6","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/death_prophet_silence_hp2.png?v=3647920","http://www.youtube.com/embed/eLBBXHVFYgU?hd=1&rel=0","Spirit Siphon","Creates a spirit link between Death Prophet and an enemy unit, draining 14 + 1% Max HP per second and slowing the enemy's movement speed by 5%.","","70/65/60/55","","ABILITY: Unit Target,AFFECTS: Enemy Units,DAMAGE TYPE: Magical,PIERCES SPELL IMMUNITY: No,BASE DAMAGE: 14,MAX HP AS DAMAGE: 1% / 2.5% / 4% / 5.5%,DURATION: 6,ENEMY SLOW: 5% / 10% / 15% / 20%,MAX CHARGES: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4,CHARGE RESTORE TIME: 45","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/death_prophet_spirit_siphon_hp2.png?v=3647920","","Exorcism","Unleashes evil spirits to drain the life of nearby enemy units and structures.

"Pugna","Ranged","Nuker - Pusher","In the realm of Pugna's birth, near the vents of the Nether Reaches, there stood a lamasery devoted to the Arts of Oblivion, which drew its power from the nether energies. The Grandmaster of the temple compound had himself passed into Oblivion several years prior, leaving his academy without a leader. From the moment of their master's death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master's reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children.  Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama's, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying 'Mine!'

The final rite, the rite of shades, is a harrowing spiritual journey through the Nothl Realm, an unpredictable domain from which not all visitants return.  Of those who do, some return mad. Others return with strange aptitudes. But all who go there are changed by their experiences. Driven by the need for enlightenment, Dazzle was the youngest of his tribe ever to request the sacred ritual. At first the order refused him, saying he was too young. But Dazzle was not to be dissuaded. Sensing something special in the headstrong young acolyte, the elders relented. Dazzle drank down the sacred potion and sat by the fire while the rest of his tribe danced through the night. In this ethereal dimension of the Nothl Realm, the properties of light and dark are inverted. Thus his brilliant healing light, beautiful to our eye, is actually a sinister kind of evil; and the darkest deeds are done in a dazzling glow. The elders' intuition was prophetic: Dazzle returned to his people as a Shadow Priest like none seen before, with the power to heal as well as to destroy.

The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells--four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one--with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap--a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world's first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world's dying days.","16 + 4.00","14 + 1.90","17 + 1.70","19 - 25","280","0.96","3","1","473","208","35-41","1","1800 / 800","600","900","15","925","936","91-97","5","1800 / 800","600","900","25","1,628","1,716","151-157","10","1800 / 800","600","900","14","Quas","None","","","","ABILITY: No Target,HP REGEN PER INSTANCE: 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 / 6 / 7,BONUS STRENGTH: 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 14","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/invoker_quas_hp2.png?v=3647920","","Wex","None","","","","ABILITY: No Target,ATTACK SPEED PER INSTANCE: 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 14,MOVE SPEED PER INSTANCE: 1% / 2% / 3% / 4% / 5% / 6% / 7%,BONUS AGILITY: 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 14","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/invoker_wex_hp2.png?v=3647920","","Exort","None","","","","ABILITY: No Target,DAMAGE PER INSTANCE: 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15 / 18 / 21,BONUS INTELLIGENCE: 2 / 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 12 / 14","http://cdn.dota2.com/apps/dota2/images/abilities/invoker_exort_hp2.png?v=3647920","","Invoke","Combines the properties of the elements currently being manipulated to create a new spell for Invoker to use.

"Shadow Demon","Ranged","Support - Disabler - Initiator - Nuker","Among the sovereign Demons with explicit access to this world, Doom scarcely bothers with the affairs of Noninfernals and Lesser Spectral Consorts, while Shadow Fiend passes through almost exclusively on collecting expeditions. The Shadow Demon, however, has always taken a deep and abiding interest in the material plane, as if sensing that mastery of this gritty dimensional nexus might be the key to total domination of all realities. Summoned first by minor wizards, the Shadow Demon granted every wish and put on increasingly impressive displays of power until he had the full attention of the greatest demonologists, and through them the various lords, tyrants, autarchs and heirophants who depended on sorcery to buttress their mundane power. So great was his deception that all his summoners considered themselves the master and Shadow Demon the servant; meanwhile, he eroded their identities and made their minds his own. In the end, most members of the cult were hollow puppets, extensions of his evil will. What Shadow Demon's next step would have been remains open to speculation, for around this time, Nevermore the Shadow Fiend bit into a particularly nasty-tasting soul and discovered that it held nothing but a foul nougat of Shadow Demon's essence. Alerted that a coup was underway, and that the ancient equilibrium of the Umbral Pact was about to be destabilized, Doom and Shadow Fiend briefly joined forces to destroy the burgeoning cult. Combining spells of incredible force, they undid Shadow Demon's centuries of patient work, reducing his cult to smithereens--and all its members to a bloody splatter. Nothing remained except a tiny speck of demon shadow. Immortal and irreducible, this mote of evil was enough to seed the Shadow Demon's next scheme, and in fits and starts, over further centuries, he began to regroup. Whatever that speck of shadow touched, it tainted, and its influence gradually grew. A chaos of damaged parts pulled together, reknit, and combined to give Shadow Demon a form even stronger than his former. He is all but complete now, and his plan for infinite dominion lacks all of its former weaknesses. It would seem that such a being of pure malice and malevolence, a threat to all creation, would be forever out of place in our world...yet Shadow Demon does not lack for followers.","23 + 2.70","18 + 2.20","17 + 1.90","27 - 31","295","2.52","3","1","473","299","50-54","3","1800 / 800","500","900","15","978","790","88-92","7","1800 / 800","500","900","25","1,719","1,401","135-139","13","1800 / 800","500","900","5","Disruption","Banishes the targeted unit from the battlefield for a short duration.

The epics of the Eldwurms have a long and colorful history, but some fear that the remaining dragon scholars are not as prolific as they once were, with few lines added to the Eldwurm Eddas since the last age of greatness. Auroth laments: 'We forget that there is more to life than triumph and dominion over enemies. We must also live our lives in the pursuit of creative expression.' She embarks on research expeditions, collecting books for inspiration. But all this research can be terribly distracting, and she spends less time writing than she should. Although she knows she should be lurking in her lair, adding to the Eddas, she finds herself engaged in epic battles against powerful enemies. She loots castles, raids ancient libraries ... and if she happens to heap glory on herself in the process, she tells herself that it's merely a side effect of her research. The fact is, while her skill and power on the battlefield are legendary, her scholarly travails have thus far hardly been the stuff of literary acclaim.
